# 🥗 Silent Hunger Discovery Engine (SHDE)  
### Predictive Analytics for Micronutrient Deficiency Risk in South Asia (2010–2030)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**"Silent Hunger"** (micronutrient deficiency) affects over **2 billion people globally**. Unlike visible malnutrition, it often remains undetected until irreversible health damage occurs.  

The **Silent Hunger Discovery Engine (SHDE)** is a research-driven predictive analytics project that integrates:

- Public health indicators  
- Economic stress signals  
- Nutritional trend data  

This study focuses on **Pakistan and India (2010–2025)** to examine how economic variables—particularly **Food CPI (Food Inflation)**—influence national-level nutritional outcomes.

## 🔍 Key Research Questions

- **Temporal Trends:**  
  How have anemia, stunting, and wasting prevalence evolved over the last 15 years?

- **Economic Correlation:**  
  Does higher Food CPI (inflation) correlate with increased micronutrient deficiency risk?

- **The Shadow Effect:**  
  How does food inflation today affect nutritional health 12 months later?

- **Predictive Analytics:**  
  Can we forecast micronutrient deficiency risk for 2030 based on current trajectories?

## 🛠 Methodology & PACE Roadmap

| Phase      | Notebook | Objective | Key Outcome |
|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Plan** | `01_Research_Mapping` | Define theoretical framework & hypotheses | Structured indicator framework |
| **Analyze** | `02_Data_Acquisition` | Ingest & harmonize multi-source global datasets | Wide-to-Long (Melted) dataset |
| **Construct** | `03_EDA_Statistics` | Pattern discovery, outlier handling, feature engineering | Clean Master Dataset |
| **Execute** | `04_Modeling_Forecast` | Machine Learning modeling & risk scoring | 74.4% Accurate Random Forest Model + 2030 Forecast |

## 📈 Key Findings

- **12-Month Lag Effect:**  
  Inflation impacts households immediately, but peak nutritional deterioration appears approximately one year later.

- **Country Sensitivity:**  
  Pakistan shows higher nutritional risk sensitivity to Food CPI volatility compared to India.

- **Feature Importance:**  
  - Food CPI  
  - Country-specific economic baselines  
  - Inflation-adjusted indicators  

  These emerged as the strongest predictors of micronutrient deficiency risk.
