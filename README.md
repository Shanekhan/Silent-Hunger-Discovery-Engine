# 🌍 Silent Hunger Discovery Engine: A 0-to-Eternity AI Initiative
### Predictive Analytics for Global Micronutrient Deficiencies

## 📌 Project Overview
"Silent Hunger" (Micronutrient Deficiency) is a global health crisis affecting over **2 billion people** worldwide. Unlike clinical malnutrition, it remains invisible until it causes irreversible damage to human health, cognitive development, and economic productivity. 

This research-led project aims to build an **Early-Warning System** that predicts vitamin and mineral deficiencies by triangulating digital footprints, socio-economic shifts, and environmental stressors before clinical symptoms arise.

## 🛠 Strategic Methodology (R-PACE Framework)

### 🔬 Phase 1: Deep Research & Problem Mapping (Notebook 01)
* **Demographic Vulnerability:** Quantifying the impact of deficiency on children (stunting), adults (chronic fatigue), and the elderly (immune collapse).
* **The "Soda & Soil" Nexus:** Analyzing the correlation between the rise of ultra-processed diets (soda/junk food) and the mineral depletion of global topsoil.
* **Mortality & Disability Research:** Mining clinical data to link deficiencies to maternal mortality and preventable blindness.

### 📊 Phase 2: Data Acquisition & Engineering (Notebook 02-03)
* **Digital Footprints:** Utilizing **Google Trends API** to track regional search spikes for symptoms like lethargy, hair loss, and joint pain.
* **Economic Scraping:** Using **Python (Scrapy/BeautifulSoup)** to monitor Global Food Price Indices and inflation rates.
* **Geospatial Intelligence:** Integrating satellite-derived data on soil health and climate-driven nutrient loss.

### 🧠 Phase 3: AI Modeling & Risk Prediction (Notebook 04)
* **Predictive Engine:** Training Neural Networks to calculate **Deficiency Probability Scores** based on cross-factor toxicity (e.g., High Inflation + High Humidity = Iron Deficiency Spike).
* **Heatmap Generation:** Visualizing high-risk zones using geospatial libraries for humanitarian intervention.

### 💻 Phase 4: Full-Stack Product Development
* **Backend:** Developed with **FastAPI** to handle real-time data pipelines and model inference.
* **Frontend:** A high-end **React.js** dashboard featuring an interactive **3D Globe (Mapbox/Deck.gl)** for global risk visualization.
* **UI/UX:** Focused on "Connected Health" principles, providing actionable insights for NGOs and Governments.
