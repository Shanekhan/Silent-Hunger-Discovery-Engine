# Silent Hunger Discovery Engine (SHDE)
### Predictive Analytics for Micronutrient Deficiency Risk

## Project Overview
Micronutrient deficiencies (“Silent Hunger”) affect over 2 billion people globally and often remain undetected until long-term health, cognitive, and economic damage occurs. Unlike calorie-based malnutrition, these deficiencies persist even in populations with adequate food intake due to systemic economic, environmental, and dietary factors.

The Silent Hunger Discovery Engine (SHDE) is a research-driven analytics project aimed at identifying and predicting population-level micronutrient deficiency risk by integrating public health indicators, economic stress signals, and digital behavioral data.

The objective is to enable early risk identification to support evidence-based public health decision-making.

## Research Objectives
- Analyze long-term trends (2000–2024) in key micronutrient deficiency indicators
- Examine the relationship between food affordability and nutritional outcomes
- Identify high-risk population groups across age and geography
- Quantify the downstream health and socio-economic impact of hidden hunger
- Develop an interpretable risk-scoring framework for early warning

---

## Key Research Questions
- Have micronutrient deficiencies increased or decreased over time?
- Is food price inflation associated with higher deficiency prevalence?
- Which population groups are most vulnerable (children, adults, elderly)?
- What structural factors (diet transition, soil depletion) correlate with observed trends?
- What are the long-term health and economic consequences of untreated deficiencies?

## Methodology (R-PACE Framework)

### Phase 1: Research & Problem Mapping (Notebook 01)
- Scientific literature review on micronutrient deficiencies
- Vulnerability analysis across demographic groups
- Hypothesis formulation and analytical assumptions

### Phase 2: Data Acquisition & Harmonization (Notebook 02–03)
- WHO: Anemia prevalence
- UNICEF: Stunting and wasting indicators
- World Bank: Food price inflation indices
- Google Trends: Symptom-related search behavior
- Data cleaning, standardization, and temporal alignment

### Phase 3: Modeling & Risk Analysis (Notebook 04)
- Feature engineering across health, economic, and digital domains
- Explainable statistical and machine learning models
- Deficiency risk scoring and comparative analysis

### Phase 4: Visualization & Deployment (Planned)
- Interactive dashboards for policy-level insights
- API-based model access (FastAPI)
- Web-based visualization layer (React.js)

---

## Technology Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Google Trends API (PyTrends)
- Data Visualization Libraries
- Git & GitHub

---

## Project Timeline
- Phase 1: Research & Question Formalization
- Phase 2: Data Engineering & Integration
- Phase 3: Modeling & Interpretation
- Phase 4: Visualization & System Packaging

---

## Scope & Ethics
- Population-level analysis only
- No individual-level diagnosis
- Transparent assumptions and limitations
- Designed to support research and policy, not clinical decision-making

---

## Collaboration
This is an open research project. Contributions from data scientists, economists, and public health researchers are welcome.
