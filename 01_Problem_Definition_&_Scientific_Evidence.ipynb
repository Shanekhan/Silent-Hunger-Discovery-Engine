    "This notebook establishes the **scientific, economic, and structural rationale** behind the Silent Hunger Discovery Engine (SHDE).  \n",
    "It is intentionally **research-focused and code-light**, serving as the conceptual foundation before any data engineering or modeling work begins.\n",

    "## Phase 1: Global Evidence of Micronutrient Deficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Global Nutrient Inadequacy (Harvard T.H. Chan, 2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024, researchers at **Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health** published a global dietary assessment covering **185 countries**, revealing the scale of micronutrient inadequacy worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study showed that **more than half of the global population** fails to meet recommended intake levels for essential micronutrients, even when caloric intake is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most widespread deficiencies:**\n",
    "- Iron\n",
    "- Calcium\n",
    "- Vitamin C\n",
    "- Vitamin E\n",
    "\n",
    "| Micronutrient | Population with Inadequate Intake |\n",
    "|--------------|----------------------------------|\n",
    "| Iodine | ~68% |\n",
    "| Vitamin E | ~67% |\n",
    "| Calcium | ~66% |\n",
    "| Iron | ~65% |\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings redefine malnutrition as a **nutritional quality crisis**, not merely a calorie deficit.\n",

    "## Phase 2: South Asia as a High-Risk Region\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Pakistan & India (UNICEF / FAO)\n",
    "\n",
    "South Asia—particularly **Pakistan and India**—represents a high-risk region where multiple forms of malnutrition coexist within the same populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Triple Burden of Malnutrition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension | Manifestation |\n",
    "|---------|---------------|\n",
    "| Undernutrition | Stunting and wasting |\n",
    "| Micronutrient Deficiency | Anemia, zinc, iodine deficiency |\n",
    "| Overnutrition | Obesity and metabolic disorders |\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic pressure has accelerated a dietary shift away from traditional, nutrient-dense foods toward **cheap ultra-processed alternatives**, driven by affordability rather than preference.\n",

    "## Phase 3: The Soda & Soil Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Soda & Soil Hypothesis** explains modern micronutrient collapse through two reinforcing mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Soil Depletion:**\n",
    "- Intensive monocropping\n",
    "- Loss of soil organic matter\n",
    "- Reduced mineral density in staple crops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processed Food Consumption:**\n",
    "- High sugar and phosphate intake\n",
    "- Reduced mineral absorption\n",
    "- Displacement of whole foods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nutritional Debt** accumulates when calories are consumed without adequate micronutrient intake, leading to long-term cognitive, immune, and metabolic consequences.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 4: Core Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have micronutrient deficiencies increased or decreased up to 2024?\n",
    "2. Does food price inflation precede rises in anemia, stunting, or wasting?\n",
    "3. Which population groups are most vulnerable?\n",
    "4. Can digital behavioral signals act as early warning indicators?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closing Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "Micronutrient deficiency is not a data scarcity problem—it is a **signal extraction problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Silent Hunger Discovery Engine integrates economic, health, and behavioral signals to identify nutritional risk **before clinical failure occurs**.\n"
